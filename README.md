# Mixed Messages

## Purpose of Repository

This repository is a javascript portfolio-project from [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com). It's about **learning javascript syntax** using javascript standard library (vanilla JS), and **getting familiar with GitHub Workflow** and learning **Markdown**.

## What is Mixed Messages about?

The Mixed Messages is a **command-line program**, that outputs _a randomly generated 'inspirational' message_ each time the user runs the **main.js**. There is no input required, just run the main.js in your terminal. The program logs an inspirational message to your console to make up your day! :smiley:

There are only few lines to randomly choose from as of writing this text, but who knows, maybe I'll add more for your amusement some day!

## Prerequisities

You should have [**node.js**](http:/nodejs.org) installed on your computer to be able to run javascript-files in your terminal.
